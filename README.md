 // Called APIs to create a weather webite depicting current weather and and forecated weather in a fashionable style

// Peer Review: Kyle Yok Eyh Ma
//Review: Favorites populate in the side bar nicely but the buttons are not functional. Some times the favorites will remove and populate on the first try but when a new location is loaded it will not read previous data. The main glaring feature that is missing is the dark mode. Would have been nice to have but with the time constraints I understand prioritizing the functionality of the website first. Weather data is processed nicely and the time's and date are spot on, even the time zones change.
